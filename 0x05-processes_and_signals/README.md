# Processes and signals
-  PID (i.e., process identification number) is an identification number that is automatically assigned to each process when it is created on a Unix-like operating system.
- A process is an executing (i.e., running) instance of a program. Each process is guaranteed a unique PID, which is always a non-negative integer.
> init is the only process that will always have the same PID on any session and on any system, and that PID is 1
